Analyze the following problem, and ask me questions to help me understand the problem better.

The problem is: $ARGUMENTS

Propose at least 3 alternatives, each one with pros and cons, and each pro and cons define if it is CRITICAL/MAJOR/MEDIUM/MINOR.

If the project would require new classes, read the project tree to understand the existing files.

ask me any question before starting implementing

Think again what should be better aligned with KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SOLID, etc.
