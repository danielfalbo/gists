Emulate the behaviour of the Wikiwand extension in Safari 13 using an AdGuard JavaScript filter

# Since Safari 13 the Wikiwand plugin is no longer available and they
# don't even list Safari as a supported browser anymore.
#
# Most people use some kind of ad blocker, and personally I'm using "AdGuard for Safari" which allows you
# to define filters that inject javascript code on certain domains.
#
# Simply add this to AdGuards "User filter", and any wikipedia article will be redirected to Wikiwand.
